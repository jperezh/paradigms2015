# Paradigms 2015

The final project consisted on studying the different paradigms that where able to code on PHP. For this the new version of PHP was used (version 7) which was still on development.

The project works with a puphpet virtual machine using vagrant. (www.puphpet.com) 
All the modules and required components where selected from the vagrant page where the machine was an Ubunto to hold the PHP 7 version.

To run an example simply go to the folder and run "php exampleName.php" and watch the output.

No I/O feature was added since that was not the main objective for the course.
